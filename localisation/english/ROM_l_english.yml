Carol then proclaimed martial law and suspended all civil liberties under the grounds that the violent election campaign was running the risk of plunging the nation into civil war.\nAfter sacking the old government that he had installed under the anti-semite Goga, Carol codified his new powers by ratifying the constitution, turning the government into a de facto legal dictatorship. All of the governing powers in Romania were at his hands, turning Romania from a democracy into an absolute monarchy."

 news.485.d:0 "Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, "the Captain" who preached a message of ferociously xenophobic ultra-nationalism, intense Orthodox mysticism, extremely violent anti-Semitism, a populist disdain for all the elites and a glorification of death in the service of the cause as the most beautiful, glorious, noble and erotic experience in the entire world was today sworn in as Prime Minister of Romania. With the violence of the elections, and the appointment of the Octavian Goga cabinet, the King saw no other option but to deliver the power that Codreanu desired to him by making him the leader of Romania, although Codreanu was at first reluctant to accept, he was then able to convince Carol to in fact hand him absolute and totalitarian powers over the state, effectively turning the formerly democratic country into a totalitarian dictatorship."

 news.486.d:0 "Fabricius the German Diplomat in Romania called Carol the II and had one simple demand, to put Antonescu in charge of Romania. With the fall of France, the francophile elite of Romania had lost most of its influence and say almost overnight. Antonescu partly complied with the request but also asked Carol to bestow upon him the reserve powers for Romanian heads of state. Carol yielded and, on September 5, 1940, the general became Prime Minister, and Carol transferred most of his dictatorial powers to him. The latter's first measure was to curtail potential resistance within the Army by relieving Bucharest Garrison chief Gheorghe Argeșanu of his position and replacing him with Dumitru Coroamă."

 news.487.d:0 " After the execution of Codreanu, the Iron Guard had remained silent for a long time, but they were not dead, merely laying dormant and waiting for the best opportunity to strike. They had been revived under the leadership of Horia Sima, and was organizing a coup d'état, now with Antonescu’s imprisonment the perfect opportunity had come as the general was full of resentment for the current government and wished to end the Royal Dictatorship that was bringing Romania to the brink of destruction. With his widespread influence and control over the Romanian army, especially the third army that was stationed in the eastern provinces, Antonescu’s soldier and the Iron Guard marched upon the capital, in an event that shall be known as the “March on Bucharest”. Soldiers who were meant to protect the capital from the “insurrection” as Carol had branded it, simply laid down their weapons or joined with the march. Carol managed to escape in the last moment on a train, whilst chased by elements of the Romanian army and the Iron Guard."

 news.488.d:0 " Loyalist generals of King Carol the II used loyal army elements to eliminate Romanian prime minister Corneliu Zelea Codreanu as the latter was on his way back to the capital after touring the country. Treating this as an insurrection within the army, Antonescu was quick to take charge and took full control over the situation by ordering the generals soldiers to stand down on charges of mutiny and to hand over the culprits to the authorities. After the army was curtailed, Antonescu quickly replaced the other generals with his own loyalists and effectively took full control over the armed forces of Romania, putting him, effectively, in charge of the country. After being treated as a hero after avenging the death of the popular Codreanu, Antonescu placed himself in charge of the country as a Co-Conducator who was to guide the existing Iron Guard leadership."
